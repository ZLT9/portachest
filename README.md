## Portable Chests

With **Port-a-Chest** you can craft **Portable Chests**, **Portable Large Chests**, and **Portable Ender Chests** that you can wear in your **chest slot** or in your **back [trinket](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets) slot**.

To **open** an **equipped Portable Chest**, **press** your assigned **keybinding** (B by default).  
To **open** a **held Portable Chest** instead, **right click** while **crouching**.  
If you have **multiple** Portable Chests, priority defaults to the one in your **chest slot**, followed by your **back trinket slot**, **main hand**, and **off hand**. You can configure the priority order through the mod's settings in [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).

While **hovering** over a Portable Chest, **hold Left Shift** to preview its **contents**.

> **Note:**
> 
> When used with [Variant Vanilla Blocks](https://modrinth.com/mod/variant-vanilla-blocks), Port-a-Chest adds Portable Chests and Portable Large Chests for all Vanilla wood types, plus a resource pack to replace the default versions with oak variants.

## Recipes

**Portable Chests** can be crafted with two leads and one chest.

**Portable Large Chests** can be crafted by adding one more chest above or below the first one.

Alternatively, you can **extend** a Portable Chest into a Portable Large Chest without losing any items.
